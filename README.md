## Description

e-Commerce Back End is a robust inventory tracking application launched by the command-line that integrates an API generated by Express.js, which manages a database created by Sequelize and tested in Insomnia through user input in JSON format.

## Installation

This project uses MySQL, sequelize, node Express and npm. Install these packages if you do not have them on your local machine. 

## Usage

``schema.sql`` must be sourced through the MySQL prompt prior to launching the application. Use ``npm run seed`` to then seed the generated database in the command line, then  ``node .\index.js`` to launch this application. I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to visualize, test and troubleshoot the API routes I built.

## Contribution

## Testing

Testing of code was mostly conducted in Insomnia; error messages were parsed there and in the VS Code command line. My main problem has been trying to debug the "update product" route; the database does not update with the new values I pass through in the PUT. I also need to continue to work on the product tag functionality; as seen in the walkthrough video those were not filled out.
